        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul class = "words">
            <li>Long sausage or horseshoe-shaped sausage<br>(Don't use ground beef or ground sausage!)</li>
            <br>
            <li>A pan</li>
            <br>
            <li>A cutting board (If you have one, use a wooden<br>cutting board instead of plastic)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Wooden or metal spatula<br>(Wooden is a better option)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <br>
        <ol class = "words">
            <li>On the cutting board, cut the sausage with a knife<br>into circle-shaped pieces about a quarter inch thick.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cut the sausage pieces in half.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now heat up the pan until it feels<br>slightly warm with your hand above it.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Use the side of the knife to move the sausage<br>off of the cutting board into the pan.</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>If the sausage isn't making any sound, turn up the heat.</li>
                <li>If the sausage is sizzling, keep cooking it at that heat level.</li>
                <li>If the sausage is smoking, turn down the heat and take the pan off of the hot part of the stove.</li>
                <li>If the sausage is on fire, start panicking.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Use the spatula to move the sausage around the pan. Try to cook every side of the pieces.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When the sausage is darker than the original color<br>but not black, it should be ready. If it looks like this, take the pan off of the hot section<br>of the stove and serve. You can use the spatula to get the sausage out of the pan.</li>
        </ol>
