        <h3>Toast is a very delicious side that<br>pairs well with eggs and sausage.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul class = "words">
            <li>Loaf of bread</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Toaster</li>
            <li>Optional:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Oregano</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <br>
        <ol class = "words">
            <li>Get two slices of bread from the loaf.</li>
            <li>Put both slices into the toaster.</li>
            <li>This step requires experience with different types of bread.<br>Some bread takes less time to cook, and some bread<br>takes a very long time to cook.<br>Experiment with different temperatures until you find the right one.<br>Try to toast the bread to the point where it's golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once the bread is toasted, you have two options:<br>spray the bread with butter spray,<br>or spread real butter on top of the toast.<br>Spreading the butter takes more time and experience,<br>while spraying the butter is extremely unhealthy.</li>
            <li>After you spread the butter, you should put some salt on top.</li>
            <li>For more flavor, put some oregano and garlic on top.</li>
            <li>Now, you can enjoy your toast!</li>
        </ol>
