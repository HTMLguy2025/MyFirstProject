    <h2>Here's how to make eggs:</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the pan on the stove and turn on the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour some oil onto the pan and tilt the pan<br>so the oil covers the surface.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg open on the edge of the pan <br>and pour the yolk into the pan.<br>
        Make sure you don't let the egg shell fall into the pan!</li>
        <li>Do the same with the second egg.<br>Be sure to wash your hands afterwards!</li>
        <li>Let the eggs cook for about a minute,<br>then flip the eggs over with your spatula.</li>
        <li>Flip the eggs as many times as required<br>and let them cook until they stop looking wet.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs look done, use the spatula to pick them up and put them onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Now your eggs are finished cooking!<br>You can put some salt on top of them to enhance the flavor,<br>or you can experiment with other spices.</li>
    </ol>
